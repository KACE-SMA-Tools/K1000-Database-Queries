# K1000-Database-Queries
These queries were mostly written for Dickinson College and the Dell KACE K1000 appliance. 
Many of them contain specific values that will only be valid for Dickinson (e.g. service desk queue IDs and custom 
inventory rules) but they may be helpful as a reference for others. I have tried to name with with a 
descriptive of a title as possible.
